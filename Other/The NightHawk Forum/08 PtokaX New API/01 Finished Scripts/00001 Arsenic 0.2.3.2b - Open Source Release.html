I have decided to get started in making it open source so people can hopefully learn something from it and / or trust it more.<BR>The following is the description and changelog of Arsenic...<BR>QuoteArsenic is a script for PtokaX that extends the software with features like the ability to rename users and allow users to change their nick. The script started as a simple experimental script I wrote to learn a bit about LUA and to get to know the new API of PtokaX. Eventually I wanted to make it into more than just a little experiment. This is what later became the powerful script it is today. I am not a pro at LUA, but I definitely am capable enough of putting my ideas in code.<BR>Quote<BR>FND&#039;s Arsenic Script<BR>Copyright (C) 2007 by Mikhail V.
