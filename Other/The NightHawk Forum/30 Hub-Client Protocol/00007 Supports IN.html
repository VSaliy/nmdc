This allows for parts to be send stand-alone rather than the complete string as is the case with the $MyINFO string.<BR>All parts on the $IN string have a 1-byte identifier, except for the first part which is the nickname.<BR>The original tag as present in the $MyINFO string has its parts seperated by a comma (,), while in the $IN string, tag parts are seperated by a space.<BR>Also, due to the integration of OP and Bot status in the status flag in the $IN string, $OpList and BotList/$BotList can be deprecated.<BR>The status flag has been extended from a 4-bit value to a 32-bit value of which the first 8 have been defined.<BR>The first 4 bits will be the same as the original status flag with:<BR>bit 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set to 1 by all clients by default<BR>bit 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set if user is Away<BR>bit 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set if user is server<BR>bit 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set if user is fireball<BR>The next 5 bits are now defined and implemented in $IN as followed:<BR>bit 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set if user is OP<BR>bit 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set if $IN belongs to a Bot<BR>bit 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set if the client is in DND mode<BR>bit 8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set if the client supports encryption<BR>bit 9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set if the client supports partial search<BR>Hereunder an example of a $MyINFO string and an $IN string during login:<BR>$IN Daywalker$CDSL$F $S4799106616$TCZ++ V2.06 MA H2/4/20 S1 L30$|<BR>$MyINFO $ALL Daywalker &lt;Z++ V:2.06,M:A,H:2/4/20,S:1,L:30&gt;$ $DSL $$4799106616$|<BR>Next, an example of a client updating its hubcount and open slots for both $MyINFO and $IN strings<BR>$IN [RO]<B>[RDS]robydjx$TH28/0/1 S29$|<BR>$MyINFO $ALL [RO]<B>[RDS]robydjx &lt;++ V:0.698,M:A,H:28/0/1,S:29&gt;$ $0.005$$33594552321$|<BR>For more information on the $IN string, see $IN<BR>Support IN is based on original design by Ptaczek and finished by PPK, Daywalker and CrazyGuy<BR>bit 9 is designed by The Architect and CrazyGuy<BR>*** Awaiting draft update, don&#039;t implement current draft ! ***</B></B></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
