To populate its user list, a $MyINFO for each user is enough. $Hello is still accepted, for adding bots to the user list. DC++ still sends a $GetNickList to indicate that it is interested in the user list. During login, hubs must still send $Hello after $ValidateNick to indicate that the nick was accepted.<BR></TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
