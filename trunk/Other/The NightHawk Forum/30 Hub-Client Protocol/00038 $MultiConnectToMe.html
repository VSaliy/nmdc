When a local client sends $MultiConnectToMe to the hub, it is forwarded on to every hub which is linked to by UDP, as in the $Search hub&lt;-&gt;hub protocol command.<BR>This command is used in conjunction with $MultiSearch. Neither is supported in DC++, though there was limited support in a couple versions of oDC. This support was problematic, as the NeoModus Direct Connect Hub did not provide a way to indicate that it was part of a link, and further did not provide the ability to broadcast joins and parts of remote users. Thus, oDC would send $MultiConnectToMe commands even when the remote user was offline.<BR>Example<BR>Quote$MultiConnectToMe RemoteNick 192.168.184.138:19346</TD></TR></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
