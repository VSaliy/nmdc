I also have examples of playing chess and battleship, all quite rough, but the purpose has been to demonstrate the concept. A screenshot is here: http://www.peeraware.com/PlayCardGame.jpg<BR>Other than that it works much like dc++ except that it indexes contents of shared documents.<BR>The script is written in html/javascript and are quite simple. You get to receive, transmit and broadcast messages from javascript, and do whatever you want based on those operations.<BR>How the scripting works is that the hub sets up the script that clients should load, and all clients that connect automatically load the script upon joining. Incompatible clients only get normal chat.<BR>Anyway, you might find it interesting, it is available here: http://www.peeraware.com/</TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" align="left"><B>CrazyGuy<BR></B>Administrator<BR>Full Member<BR> Offline<BR>Posts: 169<BR></TD><TD valign="top" align="left"><table width="100%" border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><BR></TD><td valign="middle">Re: PeerAware Beta 5<BR>&#171; <B>Reply #1 on:</B> October 05, 2007, 09:03:06 PM &#187;</TD><td align="right" valign="bottom" height="20"></TD></TR></TABLE>Hey Jonn Rein,<BR>I&#039;ve had a look around at your website and the screenshot you provided in your post.

Does this mean that the client is carrying the scripts&#039; code and the hub initializes a start procedure ?</TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" align="left"><B>Jonn Rein<BR></B>Newbie<BR> Offline<BR>Posts: 7<BR></TD><TD valign="top" align="left"><table width="100%" border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><BR></TD><td valign="middle">Re: PeerAware Beta 5<BR>&#171; <B>Reply #2 on:</B> October 05, 2007, 09:35:12 PM &#187;</TD><td align="right" valign="bottom" height="20"></TD></TR></TABLE>I think you got it just about right:<BR>On login to the hub you get a message from the hub: $HubScript url|<BR>The client then loads this hubscript and displays that before accepting more input from the hub.<BR>The Texas Hold&#039;em poker hubscript is here: http://www.peeraware.com/hubscript/cardgame/hub.html<BR>When you create a hub in peeraware you specify that this hubscript should be active in the hub.

The hub part runs as a service. All communication can be encrypted but then it is not compatible with dc++ unfortunately. There is no ADC support yet either. It does have support for proxying passive to passive connections through the hub, so you can search and download from all PeerAware clients in a hub. Of course you can choose to not allow this when setting up the hub. Anyway, play with it and see what you think. :)</TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" align="left"><B>CrazyGuy<BR></B>Administrator<BR>Full Member<BR> Offline<BR>Posts: 169<BR></TD><TD valign="top" align="left"><table width="100%" border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><BR></TD><td valign="middle">Re: PeerAware Beta 5<BR>&#171; <B>Reply #4 on:</B> October 05, 2007, 10:30:59 PM &#187;</TD><td align="right" valign="bottom" height="20"></TD></TR></TABLE>I will certainly do so.<BR>I like the idea of having a graphical interface available over the textual mainchat. I myself have been playing with the idea of introducing streaming video into Direct Connect although this may be hard to accomplish bandwith wise.<BR>As for compatibility with ADC, I don&#039;t see the use for it. ADC has not fully been developed yet (as a matter of fact it seems to lay still for about a year now), it&#039;s incomplete and doesn&#039;t seem to have any benefits over the original NMDC protocol. Improvements to NMDC protocol are an easier solution than implementing a new protocol. Also, I&#039;m not aware of any major used hubsofts supporting the ADC protocol.<BR>A question i have on $HubScript url| is the following: In the event of the number of available scripts becoming extremely large, what will be the result on the client having to download and initiate all these scripts ?<BR>I understand that the &quot;hubowner&quot; has the choice on which scripts to have enabled in his/her hub. But, in my experience, most hubs run an average of more than 5 scripts and if games become available as scripts I&#039;m pretty sure this number will increase dramatically.<BR>I will take a look at the client and come with more feedback on monday.</TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" align="left"><B>CrazyGuy<BR></B>Administrator<BR>Full Member<BR> Offline<BR>Posts: 169<BR></TD><TD valign="top" align="left"><table width="100%" border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><BR></TD><td valign="middle">Re: PeerAware Beta 5<BR>&#171; <B>Reply #5 on:</B> October 05, 2007, 10:43:28 PM &#187;</TD><td align="right" valign="bottom" height="20"></TD></TR></TABLE>As an addition to my talk about improvements to the NMDC protocol, I&#039;d like to point out 2 recently written Supports that may be of interrest to your client as well.<BR>ACTM<BR> which replaces $ConnectToMe and $RevConnectToMe commands<BR>IN<BR> which replaces the $MyINFO string<BR>Feel free to ask any questions about them if they are unclearly documented&nbsp; :)</TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" align="left"><B>CrazyGuy<BR></B>Administrator<BR>Full Member<BR> Offline<BR>Posts: 169<BR></TD><TD valign="top" align="left"><table width="100%" border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><BR></TD><td valign="middle">Re: PeerAware Beta 5<BR>&#171; <B>Reply #6 on:</B> October 14, 2007, 09:05:33 PM &#187;</TD><td align="right" valign="bottom" height="20"></TD></TR></TABLE>On first glance,<BR>The appearance looks very simple but is effective.<BR>Compatibility with NMDC isn&#039;t all that great tho.<BR>A PeerAware client cannot log into a NMDC hubsoft because it sends wrong protocol commands.<BR>And a NMDC client logging into a PeerAware hub works but it doesn&#039;t get an optimized login sequence either.<BR>For example, empty lines, double MyINFO&#039;s and non-existing support UserIP.<BR>Hope this feedback helps you in development :)</TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" align="left"><B>Jonn Rein<BR></B>Newbie<BR> Offline<BR>Posts: 7<BR></TD><TD valign="top" align="left"><table width="100%" border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><BR></TD><td valign="middle">Re: PeerAware Beta 5<BR>&#171; <B>Reply #7 on:</B> October 15, 2007, 10:51:34 PM &#187;</TD><td align="right" valign="bottom" height="20"></TD></TR></TABLE>Thanks, always nice to get feedback!<BR>I worked very hard to keep everything very simple, and allow anyone to get started without configuring too much.

I certainly do not expect the DC community to pay and would be a fool to think so. However as you may have noticed if you visit the webpage PeerAware is aimed at business use and collaboration in workgroups. Some of the features should indicate this as well, among them encrypted communication, passive to passive connect through hubs acting as a proxy, indexing of shared content including indexing of all office, openoffice, pdf content etc. Any search works just like a desktop search when using google desktop search, ie. all content of shared documents are searched. PeerAware is my attempt at marrying enterprise search with the p2p model.<BR>As stated first in this thread the reason for coming here is that you seeemed interested in scripts and I wanted to see if you might find client side scripting interesting. As for not being in public hubs? I am normally in dcdev private and public hub and for the last couple of days in qsdc with nick jonnydc and always in the peeraware hub. As for not seeing normal users problems? I try really hard, and would appreciate any such report from anyone and always fix the problems as fast as possible.</TD></TR><TR><TD valign="top" align="left"><B>Lord_Zero<BR></B>Developer<BR>Newbie<BR> Offline<BR>Posts: 34<BR></TD><TD valign="top" align="left"><table width="100%" border="0"><tr><td valign="middle"><BR></TD><td valign="middle">Re: PeerAware Beta 5<BR>&#171; <B>Reply #16 on:</B> October 19, 2007, 01:19:59 PM &#187;</TD><td align="right" valign="bottom" height="20"></TD></TR></TABLE>Quote from: Jonn Rein on October 19, 2007, 12:05:32 PM<BR>but I expect that will be for business only<BR>But there are no businesses on DC.
