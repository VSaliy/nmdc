Resource Identifier (RI) Scheme name: dchub 
Status: Permanent

Scheme syntax:

   The syntax of the 'dchub' URI scheme is specified below in ABNF specified in RFC 5234:
      
	  dchub-URI   = scheme "://" authority ["/" [path]]
	  scheme      = "dchub"
	  authority   = hostname [":" port]
	  hostname    = hostname as specified in RFC 3986
	  port        = port as specified in RFC 3986, defaults to 411
	  path        = user-path ["/" [file-path]]
	  user-path   = the name of a user
	  file-path   = the path to a file or directory

   The (same) syntax of the 'dchub' URI scheme is specified below in a less verbose form:

	  dchub://<host>[:<port>][/[<user>[/[<path>]]]]

   The hostname MUST be specified.

   Examples:
      dchub://example.com
      dchub://example.com:666
      dchub://example.com/John/uploads/applications/linux.iso
      dchub://example.com:411/John/uploads/applications/linux.iso

Scheme semantics:

   The 'dchub' URI specifies a hub within the Direct Connect (DC) network. The URI may also indicate a user and a file or directory that they share.

   A Neo-Modus Direct Connect (NMDC) client, given an URL, ought to connect to the specified address with the appropriate protocol commands and sequence. 
   
   The connected client ought to request a connection to the user via the appropriate commands and sequence.

   The client ought to queue the file or directory, supplied as the file path, via the appropriate commands and sequence. 
   If the file path is omitted, then the queued file ought to be the user's file list.
   Path to a directory MUST end in a "/".

Encoding considerations:

   1. Generic Encoding

   The encoding UTF-8 SHALL be used, according to RFC 3986. 
   
   URIs originating from hubs MUST be encoded as UTF-8 regardless of hub encoding.

   2. String Comparison

   The 'user' SHOULD be considered case-sensitive but MAY be case-insensitive in hubs that mandate as such.

   The 'file-path' SHOULD be case-insensitive.

   The 'file-path' SHALL be normalized prior to string comparison.

   3. Normalization

   The URI SHOULD be syntax-based normalized according to RFC 3986 section 6.2.2, with below exceptions.

   Tokens (such as "." and "..") SHALL follow the security considerations of this document.

   Trailing slashes ("/") SHOULD NOT be normalized.

   The URI SHALL use scheme-based normalization according to RFC 3986 section 6.2.3. I.e., the following URIs are equivalent:
         dchub://example.com
		 dchub://example.com/
		 dchub://example.com:411
		 dchub://example.com:411/

Applications/protocols that use this scheme name:

   1. Generic

   Most Direct Connect clients support the 'dchub' URI scheme (or parts of it). The 'dchub' URI scheme is used by hub lists to indicate the address of a hub.

   Implementations that support the file-path syntax implicitly support the user syntax.

   Implementations that support the user syntax implicitly support the generic syntax.

   2. File-path Syntax Implementations

   Client implementations that support the URI including the file-path syntax are:
      AirDC++ and derivatives
      Neo-Modus Direct Connect client
     
   3. User Syntax Implementations

   Client implementations that support the URI including the user syntax are:
      DC++ and derivatives
      Jucy

Interoperability considerations:

   1. Inconsistency of Hub and User Accessibility

   NMDC hubs may impose constraints on connecting clients that NMDC URIs
   do not encode, including requirements to authenticate with a username
   and password, to advertise a share of a certain size or composition,
   or to originate from certain IP addresses. Similarly, a user named in
   an NMDC URI might not be available to transfer a file, or have
   removed the specified file from their share. Therefore, software
   processing an NMDC URI SHOULD anticipate frequent failure.

   2. File-Path

   The file-path reflect the user's shared files and does 
   NOT reflect a system's underlying file system.

   3. Separator

   Path separator is a slash ("/").

Security considerations:
   See the protocol specification for generic NMDC security considerations.

   1. Distributed Denial of Service Potential

   The ongoing operation of NMDC's peer to peer connections provides
   opportunities for both malicious clients on certain hubs and
   malicious hubs to coordinate clients of those hubs in connecting en
   masse to an arbitrarily specified IP address and port. Hubs SHOULD
   mitigate this risk by only relaying such connection requests when
   they can verify that the IP addresses and ports contained therein
   belong to clients initiating such peer to peer connection requests.
   Clients SHOULD effect similar amelioration through both attempting to
   reconnect only to hubs to which they have initially connected once
   and by providing upon connection referrer information regarding which
   hub has relayed to them the IP and port to which they are connecting.

   2. URI Path Encoding

   Client software SHOULD verify that NMDC URI paths remain within
   shares by ensuring that "/", "\", ".", ":", "..", and other
   meaningful tokens either do not appear or appear only where they do
   not allow unintended behavior. Client software which translates NMDC
   URIs directly into file system calls, especially, MUST disallow path
   components of "." and "..".

   In service of such a requirement, clients SHOULD either convert all
   UTF-8 text they receive to canonical form or check against prohibited
   and controlled path tokens in any form in which they might appear.

   3. Case-sensitivity Mismatches and Duplicated Shares Entries

   Matches and shares are both accidentally due to differences in filesystem case-sensitivity
   assumptions and intentionally by malicious clients can arise
   filelists containing either entirely or up to case
   identical. Client software SHOULD detect these cases and avoid
   wasteful downloading.

   4. Semantic Attacks Confusing User and Path URI Elements

   The user and path portions of NMDC URIs overlap in appearance
   sufficiently to allow malicious construction of URIs which
   deceive users into navigating to a URI to a client the share of which
   they would not intentionally view by embeddeding a string resembling
   a user name within the path. Clients cannot entirely eliminate this
   risk.

   5. Generic URI Syntax Considerations

   RFC 3986 section 7 and in particular section 7.4, "Rare IP Address
   Formats", applies to NMDC URIs.
